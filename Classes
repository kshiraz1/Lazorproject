# x = no block allowed
# o = blocks allowed
# A = fixed reflect block
# B = fixed opaque block
# C = fixed refract block
# Grid will start at top left being  0 , 0
# Step size is half blocks
# Thus ,this leads to even numbers indicating
# the rows / columns between blocks, and odd numbers
# intersecting blocks.
